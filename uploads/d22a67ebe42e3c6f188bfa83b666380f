ABOUT ME
I'm a creative and motivated university student with strong skills in C++ and a growing interest in mobile app
development. I recently started learning Flutter and I'm excited to build my first apps soon. I’ve completed courses in
Computer Science and Problem Solving, and my TOEFL IBT score of 93 shows my strong English skills. I was proud to
work as a researcher on a cybersecurity project about stream ciphers and pseudo-random number generation.
Earlier this year, I was selected for the Global UGRAD Program, a fully funded exchange supported by the U.S.
Department of State, where I studied at the University of Wyoming. During my time there, I joined the Coding Club,
explored new cultures, and grew both personally and academically. I always try to approach challenges with
curiosity, determination, and a willingness to learn.
